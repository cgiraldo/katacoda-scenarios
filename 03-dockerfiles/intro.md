Docker Images are one of the main components of Docker.

Images are composed of layers with files and binaries and information about the main process to run, exposed ports, etc.

 The main public docker image repository is dockerhub [hub.docker.com](hub.docker.com), where you can explore available images (official and community).

This scenario provides basic notions to build first-class docker images, with a small footprint and following the best-practices.
